This repo roughly follows Andrej Karpathy's [neural network zero to hero series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ&si=haqXaaXTgBLmKSLX).
The material itself is quite complete, which fills in the gaps of my neural network knowledge, and gives me a chance to implement GPT2 from scratch (yay!). The final code is executable.

You just need to connect your IDE to any cloud provider, and you are able to train your own GPT2 model. The cost is around $100
